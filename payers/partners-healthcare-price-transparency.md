### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month, though each region appears to be updated separately and at different times.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** :x: Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** :x: There are no barriers to downloading the files, though there are mostly zip files that contain thousands of other files, which makes processing a little challenging.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ❌ 99% of the files are accessible and uncorrupted, there are a few files that are not accessible, and there is one file that is corrupted irreparably (see below). Unfortunately, this results in a lower rating.

**Overall Assessment:** Partners Healthcare MRFs point to BCBS MA, HP, and Tufts. We are working to understand why this is the case and will update score.

### Payerset Notes

**Table of Contents**

[https://mrf.payerset.com/select-health](https://mrf.payerset.com/select-health)

{% hint style="info" %}
We have created a Table of Contents in order to make the files parseable, but **please note** that this does not come from Select Health and **may have incorrect or missing data**. This is intended for us and others to be able to parse the negotiated rates as part of our standardized process.

You can find the Table of Contents we created at this link:

**Update November 2024**

Select Health spells billing\_code\_modifier incorrectly in their files, which deviates from the standard schema and causes parsed data to be missing this critical field. Additionally, having gone through \~10 million records manually, this field is not populated, which leaves me to believe that the process they are employing is also not entering the data values either.

**Overall Assessment:** Select Health has not created a Table of Contents, which makes the data difficult to get. For smaller payers, this is less of an issue, as the Table of Contents can be easily crafted, but it was a very large effort to craft a Table of Contents for Select Health and we are not sure it's 100% correct because we had to make some assumptions. Additionally, we only included "in network files" as those are what typically contain the rates (and there are many rates for Select Health in these files, all of which are accessible and updated) but there could be other naming conventions we are not aware of.

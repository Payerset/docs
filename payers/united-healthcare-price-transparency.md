#### Data Quality Issues

UnitedHealthcare does not publish many MS-DRG codes, causing them to be out of compliance in that regard. Additionally, many rates that are supposed to be tagged as `institutional` are instead tagged as `professional` which leads to confusing results. These issues must be fixed to get the maximum value out of this data for UnitedHealthcare.

**Overall Assessment:** Despite the very large volumes and questionable interpretation of the assignment, Aetna consistently puts out accessible, properly-formatted files with complete data.

### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ‚ùå The Table of Contents link is not easily accessible, it spans thousands of individual files that must be downloaded in multiple steps.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted once downloaded.
* **File Download Barriers:** ‚úîÔ∏è No, there are no barriers to downloading the files.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** 99.9% of the files are accessible.

#### API Issues

United has a new API in front of their files, which makes the download process much more difficult and slow. This can be circumvented, but there is definitely a hit to performance, and file metadata is no longer feasible to get prior to parsing the data.

#### Data Quality Issues

UnitedHealthcare publishes many MS-DRG codes with 4 digits, including a leading zero, causing them to be out of compliance in that regard (though we should assume this is not intentional). Additionally, many rates that are supposed to be tagged as `institutional` are instead tagged as `professional` which leads to confusing results. These issues must be fixed to get the maximum value out of this data for UnitedHealthcare.

These files are not accessible either:

One interesting thing about UnitedHealthcare that we don't see in other payers is that they sometimes put multiple billing codes in the `billing_code` field. See the example below in which they put  `29888 AND 29882` in the same field. We do not know the reason for this, but don't believe it is in compliance.

**Overall Assessment:** Despite the very large volumes and questionable interpretation of the assignment, UnitedHealthcare consistently puts out accessible, properly-formatted files with complete data.

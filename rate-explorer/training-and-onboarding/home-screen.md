# Home Screen

The home screen contains a list of all of the analyses that you have created. If you're logging in for the first time, you'll be directed to create an analysis.&#x20;

Click on any analysis to open it. You can also use the search to find a specific analysis you have made in the past (hint: make sure to press enter after you type your search terms)

You will also see some metadata about your analyses like which Payers, NPIs, and Billing Codes you chose - hover over the tag to see the full list of selections.

In addition to finding and opening analyses, you can also Rename, Edit, Copy, and Delete analyses by clicking the 3 dots on the right side of the page for the corresponding analysis you want to alter.&#x20;
